# **Product Requirements Document (PRD) — SimbaID: Voice-Biometric Decentralized Identity**

---

## **1. Vision**

Create a secure, privacy-preserving, and accessible **on-chain identity system** that allows Africans—especially rural and underserved communities—to create and manage verifiable digital identities using **voice biometrics** and **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**. The solution works even in **offline-first** environments via satellite mesh networks, enabling integration into financial services, healthcare, land registries, and education systems.

---

## **2. Problem Statement**

* **400M+ Africans lack formal IDs** — excluding them from banking, loans, healthcare, and government benefits.
* Existing paper-based ID systems are **fraud-prone**, slow to issue, and expensive to maintain.
* Many rural areas lack **stable internet**, limiting adoption of purely online solutions.

---

## **3. Solution Overview**

**SimbaID** provides:

1. **Voice-Activated DID Creation**

   * Users enroll via a simple voice prompt in their native language.
   * AI-powered **vocal pattern recognition** verifies uniqueness.
   * **Liveness detection** ensures the voice is from a live person, not a recording.
   * DID (Decentralized Identifier) is issued and stored on-chain.

2. **ZK-Proof Credential Verification**

   * Credentials (e.g., land titles, vaccination records, microloan history) are verified without revealing raw data.
   * Uses **Polygon ID** for DID infrastructure + **zkPass** for verifiable privacy-preserving proofs.

3. **Offline-First with Satellite Mesh**

   * Operates without constant internet access.
   * Mesh nodes or portable devices sync data when connected to satellite gateways.

---

## **4. Goals & Success Metrics**

**Business Goals**

* Issue **1M DIDs** in the first 18 months.
* Enable **microloans for 200M farmers** through verified digital IDs.
* Achieve **99.8% fraud reduction** in identity-based schemes.

**KPIs**

* DID issuance success rate (>95%).
* Voice verification accuracy (>98%).
* Average DID creation time (<2 minutes offline).
* Fraud detection rate (>99%).

---

## **5. Target Users**

* **Primary**: Rural populations without formal IDs (farmers, informal traders, artisans).
* **Secondary**: NGOs, microfinance institutions, cooperatives, government agencies.
* **Tertiary**: Banks, insurance providers, educational institutions.

## **6. Technical Requirements**

### **6.1 AI Layer**

* **Data Source**: Mozilla Common Voice (Swahili, Yoruba) for multilingual training datasets.
* **Model**:

  * **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper v3 fine-tuned on Swahili/Yoruba.
  * **Voice Biometrics**: Speaker verification model (ECAPA-TDNN or ResNet-based embeddings).
  * **Liveness Detection**: CNN/RNN models for detecting replay attacks & synthetic audio.

### **6.2 Blockchain Layer**

* **DID Framework**: Polygon ID (EVM-compatible, DIDComm protocol).
* **Privacy Layer**: zkPass for zero-knowledge proof credential verification.
* **Storage**:

  * Voice embeddings stored **off-chain** (IPFS/Filecoin).
  * DID and credential hashes stored **on-chain** (Polygon PoS for low fees).

### **6.3 Offline Capability**

* Mesh Network: LoRaWAN + Starlink satellite uplink for rural sync.
* Local node caches transactions & syncs when connected to satellite/internet.

---

## **7. Functional Requirements**

1. **DID Creation**

   * User speaks a passphrase.
   * System extracts voice embeddings.
   * Liveness detection confirms authenticity.
   * DID generated & stored on-chain.

2. **Credential Binding**

   * Trusted issuer binds off-chain credential to DID (e.g., land registry → proof hash).
   * User can generate ZKPs for credential possession.

3. **Authentication**

   * User speaks passphrase.
   * System matches voice to stored embeddings.
   * Generates ZKP for service provider without revealing raw biometric.

4. **Offline Sync**

   * DID & proof requests cached locally until connectivity restored.
   * Sync occurs automatically with nearest mesh gateway.

## **9. Security & Privacy**

* **Biometric Security**: Store only encrypted voice embeddings, not raw audio.
* **ZKP Privacy**: Only proof hashes on-chain; no raw PII.
* **Smart Contract Audits**: Third-party code review.
* **AI Spoof Prevention**: Anti-replay, deepfake detection models.
